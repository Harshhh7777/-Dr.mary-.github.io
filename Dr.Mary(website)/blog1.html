  Are you tired of the constant distractions and misinformation in today's world? Have you ever felt like a mere cog in a massive machine, disconnected from your own mission? It's time to let go of the illusion and set out on a journey of self-discovery. In this blog, we will look at the importance of understanding our roots and embracing natural health science. Get ready to learn the secrets that can revolutionize your health and unlock your true potential.

</p>

<h2>Three Categories of Individuals</h2>

<p>
  <h2>As we begin this journey, consider the three types of people who emerge when confronted with the quest for truth.</h2> <br>
  The Seekers: Those who are wise enough to question the norms, analyse every aspect, and seek the underlying truths comprise the first category. These brave souls are driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and aren't afraid to question the status quo. They are the seekers who dare to question and embark on a self-discovery journey.<br>
  The Followers: Individuals who choose to follow the teachings of others are classified as followers. While they may not engage in deep introspection, they are wise enough to recognise the value of trusted sources and to align their actions accordingly. They recognise that there is wisdom in learning from those who have gone before them.<br>
  The Lost:  Unfortunately, there is a third category—those who are lost and confused, drifting aimlessly without a sense of purpose. These people, like a herd of sheep, blindly follow the crowd, oblivious to their enormous potential. But we refuse to join this flock.<br><br>

  It is critical to recognise that truth is a dynamic force that constantly unfolds before us. Truths, like the rising and setting sun, may appear to move in one direction only to reveal a more profound reality. By embracing the ever-unfolding truth, we gain the wisdom to navigate through life with clarity and purpose.


</p>

<h2>Health: Challenging Popular Notions</h2>

<p>
  Let's talk about health—the foundation on which our lives are built. In a world dominated by popular ideas and quick-fix remedies, it's time to challenge the status quo. Simply because something is popular does not mean it is true. We've strayed from the natural ways of life that have sustained humanity for centuries. 

</p>

<h2>Uncovering Ancient Wisdom for Modern Challenges</h2>
<p>The ancient scriptures contain a wealth of information waiting to be discovered. Vedanta, the collection of Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, and Neeti Shastra, is the key to understanding natural health science. Surprisingly, these texts were written before modern technology, and their wisdom far outweighs our current comprehension.
<br>
Natural Health Science is based on ancient teachings found in Vedantic scriptures and offers a comprehensive understanding of the body-mind-spirit connection. These teachings emphasize the interdependence of our internal and external environments and offer invaluable advice for achieving optimal well-being. We have frequently overlooked the timeless wisdom that has guided humanity for centuries in our pursuit of progress. It's time to embrace this age-old wisdom and harness its transformative power.
</p>

<h2>The Three Requisites for Embarking on Natural Health Science</h2>
<p>To embark on this transformative journey, we must possess three requisites:</p>
<p>Deep belief in Vedanta principles: Firstly, a deep belief in the principles described in Vedanta is essential. Vedanta provides a holistic approach to natural health science that focuses on the interconnectedness of body, mind, and spirit.</p>
<p>Unwavering trust in laws of nature: Secondly, unwavering faith in the laws of nature are necessary. The laws of nature govern all life processes, and understanding these laws can help us align with our natural state of being.</p>
<p>Absence of fear or doubt: Natural Health Science encourages us to question popular notions and embrace alternative perspectives on health and wellness. To truly benefit from this approach, we need to be open-minded and willing to challenge conventional beliefs and practices. The absence of fear or doubt allows us to approach Natural Health Science with a sense of curiosity and receptiveness, enabling us to explore new ideas and concepts without prejudice.</p>

<h2>Harnessing the Inherent Healing Power</h2>
<p>At the core of Natural Health Science lies a profound truth: our bodies possess an extraordinary capacity for self-healing and vitality. Unlike conventional medicine, which often focuses on suppressing symptoms, Natural Health Science delves deeper to address the root causes of ailments. By harnessing the inherent healing power within us, we can achieve lasting results that go beyond mere temporary relief.</p>

<h2>Eminent Doctors and Practitioners of Natural Health Science</h2>
<p>Many doctors and practitioners of medicine from different parts of the world have come out independently to declare that taking medicines is not improving our health, but it is actually ruining our health. They declared a war against medicine and advocated Natural Health Science as the only way to solve all our health problems.
</p>
<p>Some famous natural health science practitioners include Dr. Tilden, Dr. Isaac Jennings, Dr. Henry Linder, Sylvester Graham, Arnold Russell, Louis Kunhe, Dr. T.C. Fry, Herbert Shelton, and many others. Each of these practitioners had unique contributions to Natural Health Science, such as:
</p>

<p>
  Dr. Tilden: A visionary ahead of his time, Dr. Tilden boldly questioned the prevailing medical norms and championed the use of natural remedies and healthy lifestyle choices. He recognized the body's inherent capacity to heal itself when provided with the right tools and advocated for a holistic understanding of wellness.


</p>
<p>
  Dr. Isaac Jennings: An influential figure in Natural Health Science, Dr. Jennings introduced the groundbreaking concept of the no-breakfast plan. By encouraging individuals to allow their bodies to rest and rejuvenate before consuming food in the morning, he emphasized the importance of aligning our habits with the body's natural rhythms.

</p>
<p>
  Dr. Henry Linder: Dr. Linder's contributions to natural health were centered around the powerful practice of fasting. He believed that fasting provided the body with an opportunity to cleanse and regenerate, leading to improved overall health and vitality.
</p>
<p>
  Sylvester Graham: A visionary of his time, Graham highlighted the significance of a whole foods, plant-based diet for optimal health. He promoted the consumption of natural, unprocessed foods, and is best known for creating the wholesome Graham cracker as a nutritious alternative to the unhealthy snacks of his era.


</p>
<p>
  Arnold Russell: Russell's advocacy for natural health emphasized the importance of a balanced lifestyle encompassing regular physical exercise, exposure to fresh air, and proper nutrition. He encouraged individuals to take responsibility for their own well-being and embrace the power of self-healing.

</p>
<p>
  Louis Kuhne: Kuhne's groundbreaking work, "The New Science of Healing," challenged conventional medical practices and shed light on the body's natural healing abilities. His emphasis on hydrotherapy as a therapeutic treatment and the importance of maintaining a clean internal environment resonated deeply with those seeking natural solutions.


</p>
<p>
  Dr. T.C. Fry: Dr. Fry played a pivotal role in promoting the benefits of a raw food diet. His teachings focused on the detrimental effects of cooking on the nutritional content of food and emphasized the consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, and raw plant-based foods for optimal health.

</p>
<p>
  Herbert Shelton: Shelton's significant contributions centered around natural hygiene and fasting. He advocated for a clean and healthy lifestyle, emphasizing the body's inherent ability to heal itself when provided with the right conditions.


</p>
<p>
  These doctors and practitioners, along with many others, have made significant contributions to Natural Health Science. Their work has provided valuable insights into the holistic approach to health and well-being, inspiring countless individuals to embrace natural remedies and healthy living habits.

<h2>
  Acharya Lakshmana Sarma and his Contribution to Natural Health Science

</h2>

<p>
  Acharya Lakshmana Sarma was a leading lawyer in Pudukkottai, India. He read the book "New Science of Healing" by Louis Kunhe, which changed his life. Following the instructions in the book, he regained his health, which the doctors declared incurable. He then delved into the Vedas, composed 1500 verses on different topics, and wrote several books in English on Natural Health Science, such as "Practical Nature Cure," "Fasting Cure," and "Vital Economy."


</p>
<p>
  The vital economy principle is unique to the Indian natural hygiene system. It is not taught in the over 150 colleges that teach naturopathy worldwide. Acharya Lakshmana Sarma's books are still relevant today and have been read by millions of people worldwide.

</p>

<h2>
  Order of Creation and Priority in Healing
</h2>

<p>
  The Vedas specify the order of creation, from space to sunlight, water, and then earth. Natural Health Science follows the same order of creation in healing, starting with three subtle elements and then moving to grosser elements such as food. However, most people forget about the subtle elements and focus on the gross elements, which can lead to health problems.

</p>

<p>
  
Unlike conventional medicine, natural hygiene is affordable, accessible, and safe. Perhaps the most significant benefit of natural hygiene is that it is safe and has no risks, unlike traditional medicine. Each medicine has at least a dozen side effects, which can sometimes lead to fatal consequences. Natural hygiene is time tested and has evolved and been successful for millions of years and 8.4 million species of life on earth. However, the pressure to abandon natural hygiene approaches can be overwhelming from friends, family, and media advertisements. Temptation to try junk food or unhealthy habits, even among our families, can make healthy living more difficult. There is also a lot of pressure from commercial influences to buy unhealthy things or to wear certain clothes, watches, and fashions.

</p>

<h2>
  Escape the Medication Trap
</h2>

<p>
  The overreliance on medications has led to a culture of dependency and side effects. Natural Health Science presents a refreshing alternative. By addressing the underlying causes rather than merely managing symptoms, a lifestyle based on natural health science helps break free from the medication trap. Imagine a life where you no longer need to rely on an array of pills but instead tap into your body's innate healing potential.

<h2>
  Healthy Lifestyle Promotes Health
</h2>

<p>
  Natural hygiene emphasizes following the laws of nature. A healthier lifestyle results in better physical and mental health, whereas ignoring nature can result in poor health and suffering. Therefore, we should embrace natural hygiene for our long-term health and well-being.
<br>
Natural Health Science embraces a holistic lifestyle
<br>
Mental clarity, emotional harmony and spiritual growth are important parts of achieving true well-being
<br>
In a world dominated by synthetic medications and quick fixes, there is a growing need to reevaluate our approach to health and well-being. Natural Health Science, is a paradigm-shifting discipline that taps into the innate wisdom of our bodies and offers a holistic path to unparalleled well-being.
